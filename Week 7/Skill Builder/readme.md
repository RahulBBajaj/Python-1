[Q1. High School TopCoder -Green Wood High School is set to premier a programming tournament for high school-aged math and science students across the country. Based on this contest, the school has called in for all the interested candidates to take up a qualifying test at the school premises.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%207/Skill%20Builder/High%20School%20TopCoder%20Green%20Wood%20High%20School%20is%20set%20to%20premier%20a%20programming%20tournament%20for%20high%20school-aged%20math%20and%20science%20students%20across%20the%20country.py)

[Q2. Write a program to obtain the radius of the circle as a parameter and use three different functions to find the diameter, circumference, and area of the circle. Each function should return the respective values.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%207/Skill%20Builder/Write%20a%20program%20to%20obtain%20the%20radius%20of%20the%20circle%20as%20a%20parameter%20and%20use%20three%20different%20functions%20to%20find%20the%20diameter%2C%20circumference%2C%20and%20area%20of%20the%20circle.py)

[Q3. Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculates the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%207/Skill%20Builder/Write%20a%20program%20that%20accepts%20a%20string%20S%2C%20and%20characters%20c1%2C%20c2.py)

[Q4. Winter Challenge -Swapna is a regular reader of Youth Digest magazine.

[Q5. Write a function to check whether a number is perfect or not. In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%207/Skill%20Builder/Write%20a%20function%20to%20check%20whether%20a%20number%20is%20perfect%20or%20not.py)

[Q6. Write a Python function to reverse words in a string.Call the function in the main program along with the given input to get the output.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%207/Skill%20Builder/Write%20a%20Python%20function%20to%20reverse%20words%20in%20a%20string.py)

[Q7. Best Programmer -Baldwin High School's Best Programmer Contest is organized today and the contest hones the students coding skills by making them solve different challenges. Based on the speed and accuracy with which the students finish the challenges, the Event coordinators will rank the participants and reward them. ](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%207/Skill%20Builder/Best%20Programmer%20Baldwin%20High%20School.py)
