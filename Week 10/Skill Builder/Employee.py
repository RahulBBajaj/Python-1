#Create a class name Employee with the instance attribute firstname and lastname.
#Form the email by joining the first and last name together with a "." in between, and follow it with '@company.com' at the end. Make sure everything is in lowercase.
#Examples:
#emp_1 = Employee("John", "Smith")
#emp_2.email âžž "mary.sue@company.com"
