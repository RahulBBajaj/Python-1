# Week 13 Skill Builder

[You are given 2 values a , b and Number of test cases T. Perform Integer division and print the value of a // b. In the case of ZeroDivisionError or ValueError, print the error code.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%2013/Skill%20Builder/ZeroDivisionError.py)

[Write a function called display() to display the following details. name (Datatype should be string) deposit amount (Datatype should be float) cost per day (Datatype should be float)](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%2013/Skill%20Builder/Invalid_Input_format.py)

[Write a python script to find the reciprocal of the given list values and if there is any exception throw that to the user. The given list is a Random list.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%2013/Skill%20Builder/reciprocal.py)

[write an interactive calculator! User input is assumed to be a formula that consists of a number, an operator (at least + and -), and another number, separated by white space (e.g. 1 + 1). Split user input using str.split(), and check whether the resulting list is valid:](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%2013/Skill%20Builder/interactive_calculator.py)

[Given N values, Write a program to find the sum of the N values. If the user input is less than N values, then print Index Error message.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%2013/Skill%20Builder/sum_of_the_N_values.py)

[Write a program to assume an integer and find whether the given number is large or small than the given input. If the number is above or below the user input throw the user-defined exception as “Value is Small” or “Value is large”. If it matches with the user assumption display the message as “Well Done”. This process should be continued till the user prompts the symbol $.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%2013/Skill%20Builder/given_number_is_large_or_small.py)

[Write a program to get the input as integer from the user. If the input is not a valid integer throw an exception error displaying 'Invalid Integer'. If the given input is valid integer, display 'Valid Integer'](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%2013/Skill%20Builder/Valid_Integer.py)

[Write a program to obtain the cost for 'n' days of an item and n as input and calculate the cost per day for the item. In case, zero is given as input for n, an arithmetic exception is thrown, handle the exception and prompt the user accordingly with an error message 'Division by Zero'](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%2013/Skill%20Builder/Division_by_Zero.py)
