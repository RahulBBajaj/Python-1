# Week 12 Challenge Yourself

[Create a class 'Complex' to add two complex numbers. The complex number contains the real parts and the imaginary parts. Create two objects c1 and c2. c1 passes the first complex number. c2 passes the second complex number. Create a method overloading for the '+' operator, so that it should perform complex numbers addition. After creating objects c1 and c2, c1+c2 should display the addition of 2 complex numbers.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%2012/Challenge%20Yourself/class_complex.py)

[MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE We can implement multi-level inheritance in our application. Let's consider the domain 'Stall' and its types. There exists a multilevel inheritance.Create a class SilverStall with the following attributes.Attributes: name (String), detail (String), owner (Sting), cost (float)Total cost computes only the stall cost](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%2012/Challenge%20Yourself/SilverStall.py)

[Create a multilevel inheritance based on the image given below. Create suitable attributes and methods as shown in the below table. Get the details from the user and display the data with the total bill amount.Create an object only from 'Bill' clause and display all the patient details (check output format) along with the calculated Bill amount.](https://github.com/atharva-narkhede/Python/blob/main/Week%2012/Challenge%20Yourself/bill.py)
